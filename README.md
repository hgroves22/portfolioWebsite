# Henry Groves' Portfolio Website

## Summary

I started building this website on 12/12/2024 as a side project to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The site is built from scratch using JSX and CSS with the React library, focusing on creating an intuitive user experience. I earned a certification in Responsive Web Design on 12/9/2024, which provided me with foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. This project allows me to apply and expand on what I learned, creating a personal website that reflects my technical abilities and creativity.

### Extra Information

I used the React Router library to switch between different pages in my website. This was the first time I used React Router so it was exciting to learn this powerful library. Being able to define and manage navigation within this single-page application (SPA) was very helpful when trying to hyperlink certain aspects of the page.
