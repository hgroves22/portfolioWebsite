# Henry Groves' Portfolio Website

## Summary

I started building this website on 12/12/2024 as a side project to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The site is built from scratch using JSX and CSS with the React library, focusing on creating an intuitive user experience. I earned a certification in Responsive Web Design on 12/9/2024, which provided me with foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. This project allows me to apply and expand on what I learned, creating a personal website that reflects my technical abilities and creativity.
