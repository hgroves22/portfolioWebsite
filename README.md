# Henry Groves' Portfolio Website

## Summary

I began building this website on 12/12/2024 as a side project to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The site is built from scratch using JSX and CSS with the React library, with a focus on creating an intuitive user experience. On 12/9/2024, I earned a certification in Responsive Web Design, which provided foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. This project has allowed me to apply and expand upon that knowledge by creating a personal website that highlights my technical abilities and creativity.

### Extra Information

I used the React Router library to enable navigation between different pages of the website. This was my first time working with React Router, and I found it exciting to learn this powerful library. It was particularly helpful in defining and managing navigation within this single-page application (SPA), making it easier to hyperlink and organize various sections of the site.
